1. Introduction:
- The StrokePython project is a Python-based initiative focused on training an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model and deploying it to a user interface (UI) for stroke diagnosis. This project is developed as part of a Machine Learning course within the field of Data Analytics and Artificial Intelligence at Ho Chi Minh City University of Industry and Trade.
2. Project Details
- Course: Machine Learning
- Language Used: Python
- Database: SQL Server
- Model Training Files: You can open them on Google Colab with the filename "stroke_NguyenVietThanh.ipynb" and also on Visual Studio Code with the filename "stroke_NguyenVietThanh.py" (all code explanations are provided in that file in Vietnamese).
- UI.py: Interface designed to load the trained model ("mymodel.h5") for stroke diagnosis.
